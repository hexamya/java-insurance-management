# java-insurance-management
This project aims to build and manage a database that can be beneficial for an insurance company. The insurance company needs to keep track of all the details of its target clients, policies and payments. In the project, we intend to use the concepts involved in handling the data acquired from insurance companies, clients, and policies using JAVA. The database will include multiple classes which will be managed efficiently. Some used methods which classify the clients and policies based on their relation. According to those classifications, different objects are created in database and saved.
